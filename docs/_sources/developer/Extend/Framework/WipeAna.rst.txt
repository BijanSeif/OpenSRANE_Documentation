wipeAnalysis and wipeAnalysisGlobal
-----------------------------------
	   
   wipeAnalysis and wipeAnalysisGlobal in _GlobalParameters.py and classes are very important methods that show the local and global parameters that should filled with their initial value at the begining of each analysis.

   :ref:`wipeAnalysisGlobal <wipeAnalysisEX>` contains variables that are common between all classes and after each analysis by calling wipeAnalysis command their assigned data will be clear and the initial value should be assigned to them to get ready for next analysis. These variables are those that will be use and call by the other classes in other SubPackages or call by recorders or by users to be stored for postprocess analysis. :ref:`wipeAnalysis <wipeAnalysisEX>` methos or command is resposible to reset and initialize the class local variables and the :ref:`wipeAnalysisGlobal <wipeAnalysisEX>` method should be called inside this method and by this way all global variables also will be reset. 
   
   :ref:`wipeAnalysis <wipeAnalysisEX>` in _GlobalParameters.py is for module parameters and it is responsible to initialize the parameters that are used only inside the module at the start of each analysis and remove the last analysis values from them. To making code briefer, the code only calls wipeAnalysis and so in each wipeAnalysis command the wipeAnalysisGlobal also should be called to reset the global parameters. (Watch :ref:`Example1 <FrameworkEx1>` and :ref:`Example2 <FrameworkEx2>`)
   
   So, each time that analysis command repeat, these parameters will be reset and initialize and their previous values from the last analysis will be removed. **constant variables and variables that their values won't change do not need to be defined in the** :ref:`wipeAnalysisGlobal or wipeAnalysis <wipeAnalysisEX>` **body**.
