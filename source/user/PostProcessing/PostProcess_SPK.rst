.. _PostProcessSPK:

*************************
PostProcess SubPackage
*************************

Using this subpackage, user can export some specific data or results from the recorders. Currently there are ObjsRecorder and Recorder modules for recording. In the following, some commands are described for exporting some results from recorded data are presented.

.. note::

   Using the results in the form of this section for post processing is not mandatory and users can use their own code on the resulted values from analysis of the software. Also, users can develope the current module for post proccessing or add their modules to the source code for futher usages. 
   
.. _First Step:

First Step: Load Data
---------------------
   
   At very fist step, user should load data and get the results dictionary. For :ref:`Objs_recorder <Objsrecorder>` and :ref:`Recorder <Recorder>` there are a specific command to load data and get the resutls. These commands are described in the following:
   
   * To load recorded data via :ref:`Objs_recorder <Objsrecorder>` use the following command. In this command **filename** is the name of recoded file using :ref:`Objs_recorder <Objsrecorder>` recorder. All the statistical analysis and data will be store in **Results** variable that shown in the following sample.
   
      .. code-block:: python
	     
         import opensrane as opr
  
         Results=opr.PostProcess.ObjsRecorderPP.Analyze(filename,100)
   
   * To load recorded data via :ref:`Recorder <Recorder>` use the following command. When user is using :ref:`Recorder <Recorder>` to record data and results, there are one separated file for each desired result and so finally there will be more than one file for recorded results. In this command **Recorer_FilenamesList** is the list of the recoded files name using :ref:`Recorder <Recorder>` recorder. All the statistical analysis and data will be store in **Results** variable that shown in the following sample. In the following sample it is assumed that user recorded the desired results in the mentioned file names. 
   
      .. code-block:: python
	     
         import opensrane as opr
  
         Results=opr.PostProcess.RecorderPP.Analyze(Recorer_FilenamesList=['RecorderA.OPRrec','RecorderB.OPRrec','RecorderC.OPRrec','RecorderD.OPRrec','RecorderE.OPRrec'])

Second Step: Results keys
-------------------------

   The **Results** variable that loaded using the commands mention in above part is a dictionary. In the following table the keys of this variable and their corresponding values are described.

* **Expected_Total_LOC**
   
   Using this command expected total loss of containment will be plotted.

   .. function:: PostProcess.PlotPP.Expected_Total_LOC(PPResults=None,yaxistype='log',PlotMode=1)
   
   .. csv-table:: 
      :header: "Argument", "Type", "Description"
      :widths: 10, 10, 40
   
      PPResults, str, Name of the variable that results of :ref:`First Step` are stored in.
      yaxistype, str, "Type of the yaxis ['linear', 'log', 'date', 'category','multicategory']"
      PlotMode, int, "Options between 1,2 and 3 to plot on various editors."
	  
   .. admonition:: Example:
   
      The following demonstrates the use of the mentioned command. The results are stores in a file with name 'Recorder' using :ref:`Objs_recorder <Objsrecorder>`.
   
      **Python Code**
   
      .. code-block:: python
      
         import opensrane as opr
		
         results=opr.PostProcess.ObjsRecorderPP.Analyze('Recorder',100)
		 
         opr.PostProcess.PlotPP.Expected_Total_LOC(results,'log')
    
      The result of above command is:
	  
      .. raw:: html
          :file: figures/Expected_Total_LOC.html
		  

* **ScenarioProbability**
   
   Using this command probability of scenarios will be plotted.

   .. function:: PostProcess.PlotPP.ScenarioProbability(PPResults=None,yaxistype='log',DamageLevel=[],ScenarioList=[],PlotMode=1,)
   
   .. csv-table:: 
      :header: "Argument", "Type", "Description"
      :widths: 10, 10, 40
   
      PPResults, str, Name of the variable that results of :ref:`First Step` are stored in.
      yaxistype, str, "Type of the yaxis ['linear', 'log', 'date', 'category','multicategory']"
      PlotMode, int, "Options between 1,2 and 3 to plot on various editors."
	  DamageLevel, list of int, List of damage level that user want to watch the results
	  ScenarioList, list of str, List of scenarios that want to be shown in plot. (for Empty it means that plot all scenarios)
	  
	  
   .. admonition:: Example:
   
      The following demonstrates the use of the mentioned command. The results are stores in a file with name 'Recorder' using :ref:`Objs_recorder <Objsrecorder>`.
   
      **Python Code**
   
      .. code-block:: python
      
         import opensrane as opr
		
         results=opr.PostProcess.ObjsRecorderPP.Analyze('Recorder',100)
		 
         opr.PostProcess.PlotPP.ScenarioProbability(results,'log',)
    
      The result of above command is:
	  
      .. raw:: html
          :file: figures/ScenarioProbability.html
      
      |

      And to plot just for damage level 0 and 1
	  
      .. code-block:: python
      
         import opensrane as opr
		
         results=opr.PostProcess.ObjsRecorderPP.Analyze('Recorder',100)
		 
         opr.opr.PostProcess.PlotPP.ScenarioProbability(results,'log',DamageLevel=[0,1],)
		 
      .. raw:: html
          :file: figures/ScenarioProbability01.html
		  

      |

      And if user wants to plot for some specific scenarios:
	  
      .. code-block:: python
		 
         opr.PostProcess.PlotPP.ScenarioProbability(results,'linear', ScenarioList=[f'(0):[{i}]' for i in range(1,9)],)
		 
      .. raw:: html
          :file: figures/ScenarioProbabilityScens.html
