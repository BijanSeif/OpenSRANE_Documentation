|opr| is an open-source, extensible, flexible and object-oriented software for calculating the quantitative risk of NaTech events in process plants. For performing NaTech analysis using |opr|, **Python** popular scripting languages have been extended, by extended we mean additional commands have been added to the languages.
   
The |doc| for using the software and getting familiar with the framework of the software and the platform (|githubLink|) that the package has been located and presented are described here. This documentation is divided to two parts. In the first part (:ref:`Users Guideline`) the procedure of modelling and usage of the program has been described for users and steps of modelling has been explained. In the second part (:ref:`Developers Guideline`) the |opr| framework is described for developers wishing to create their own applications or extend the existing applications.
